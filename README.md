`soren` is a modern, actively maintained Go SDK for interacting with the VyOS router operating system's GraphQL API.

This project was created as a successor to the `go-vyos` library. It will provide a complete, robust, and idiomatic Go interface for configuring, managing, and monitoring VyOS devices.

## ⚠️ Project Status ⚠️

This library is currently in **active development**. The API may have breaking changes until a stable `v1.0.0` release. Feedback and contributions are welcome.

## Intended Features

* **Full API Support:** Complete coverage for VyOS configuration (set, show, delete) and operational commands.
* **Actively Maintained:** Aims to provide a reliable, long-term solution for Go-based VyOS automation.
* **Type-Safe:** To provide type-safe helpers for common configuration paths.
