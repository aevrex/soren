`go-vyos` is a modern, actively maintained Go SDK for interacting with the VyOS router operating system's HTTP API.

This project was created as a successor to the deprecated and unmaintained `vyos-go` library. It provides a complete, robust, and idiomatic Go interface for configuring, managing, and monitoring VyOS devices.
